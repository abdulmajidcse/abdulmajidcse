### Hi, I'm Abdul Majid!



I am a backend-heavy full-stack developer and a self-learner. I am experienced for more than 3 years and working with **Laravel**, **Livewire**, **jQuery**, and **AlpineJS**. I am also experienced in **VueJS**, **Queue**, **Task Scheduling**, **VPS Server**, **CI/CD**, and **Docker (Basic)**. I love the beauty of **Laravel ORM**.

My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way.

I love to share my knowledge, mostly technical. I enjoy learning new things and building something new.
