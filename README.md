### Hi, I'm Md. Abdul Majid!

I am a backend-heavy full-stack developer and a self-learner. I am experienced for more than 4 years and working with ***Laravel*** and ***VueJS***. I am also experienced in ***Queue***, ***Task Scheduling***, ***VPS Server***, ***CI/CD***, and ***Docker (Basic)***. I love the beauty of ***Laravel ORM***.

My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way.

I love to share my knowledge, mostly technical. I enjoy learning new things and building something new.
